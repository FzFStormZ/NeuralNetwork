# NeuralNetwork
Create a simple neural network and testing with a simple example

# For what ? 
There is the minimum to begin with easy examples which use numbers or simple data

# How to use ?
- There is inputs and outputs in main class which is data to your examples
- After training with these data, there is a testing phase in order to test with new data to know if your neural network works correctly
